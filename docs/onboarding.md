# Onboarding

This onboarding guide will take you through the initial setup process, ensuring you get the most out of our service. 

## Starting the Bot

1. **Initiation**: To begin, either click the `Get Started` button on our homepage or search for `@GruntlyBot` in Telegram.
2. **Activation**: Once you're in the bot interface, press the `Start` button to initiate the onboarding process.

## Guided Tour

After pressing `Start`, the assistant will guide you through the core functionalities of the service. Simply click `Next ➡️` after each message to proceed to the next step. 

## Setting Your Interests

This is a crucial part of the process, as your interests will determine the relevance of the messages in your digest. Be specific in detailing what you're looking for.

### Examples
> I'm a startup founder in local delivery. I'm looking for investors and industry-specific communities.

> I'm a business analyst with 5 years of experience, seeking job offers aligned with my expertise. I'm also interested in questions that I can answer based on my skills.

> I'm interested in:
  1. Local vine events in Berlin
  2. Hiking in Sardinia
  3. Information about Hayao Miyazaki

For more tips on specifying your interests, check out the article [How to Indicate Your Interests](/blog/how-to-indicate-your-interests) in our blog.

## Post-Onboarding Steps

You can always modify your interests later via the settings menu.

At this point, your onboarding is complete. The next step is to inform the assistant about which groups and channels to monitor. For this, refer to our next guide: [Adding Channels](./adding-channels.md).

And that's it! You're now set up to start receiving digests tailored to your needs.
