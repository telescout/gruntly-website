# Adding Channels

In order to make the most out of Gruntly's features, it's crucial to add the channels and groups you wish to monitor.
By doing so, you enable Gruntly to sift through the information and deliver only the relevant messages right to your doorstep.

This guide outlines the various ways to add channels and groups, so you never miss an important update again.

## Methods to Add Channels

You can add channels or groups to Gruntly in several ways. Here's how:

### Method 1: Forward a Message

1. Navigate to the channel of your interest.
2. Forward any message from this channel directly to your Gruntly chat.

### Method 2: Use the Channel Name

1. Open your Gruntly chat.
2. Simply write the name of the channel, prefixed with an "@" symbol, like so: `@channelname`.

### Method 3: Provide a Channel Link

1. Open your Gruntly chat.
2. Paste the link to the channel, typically formatted as `t.me/channel`.

### Method 4: Send an Invite Link

1. Open your Gruntly chat.
2. Send an invite link for the group or chat, for example, `https://t.me/+abcddef`.

## After Adding a Channel

Upon successful addition, Gruntly will confirm that the channel or group has been added. 

However, the channel is not connected immediately; it may take up to two hours for the channel to be fully integrated into your monitoring list.
Don't be alarmed if you don't see the new channel in your settings right away. Your daily digest will include updates from the newly added channel after this period.

## Potential Issues

- If you forward a message from a group (not a channel), Gruntly won't be able to identify it at this time, use any other method in order to add this group.
- If the channel requires administrator permissions for joining, Gruntly will inform you that it can't add the channel.
