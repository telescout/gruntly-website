# Why Gruntly Isn't Free: Our Pricing Philosophy and Service Purpose

If you're here, you're likely tired of being inundated with irrelevant messages and updates from multiple channels. You probably also recognize the value of your time and mental bandwidth. That's why we built Gruntly, a personal assistant designed to distill the internet noise into a simple, curated daily digest of messages tailored to your interests and needs.

### Why We Charge

We get itâ€”people love free things. But here's the deal: Processing vast amounts of content across numerous channels isn't a walk in the park. It requires hefty computing resources to ensure that you only get messages that matter to you. Servers, bandwidth, and the technology that makes Gruntly efficient aren't free.

### Our Pricing Tiers

We offer two price tiers:

- **Free Plan**: Monitor one channel at zero cost. It's a taste of what Gruntly can do.
- **Full Plan**: For $5/month, unlock the ability to monitor up to 10 channels. Ideal for those who want the full experience.

As a bonus, every new user gets one month of the Full Plan for free. Consider it a test drive.

### Who Benefits from Gruntly

Whether you're a busy entrepreneur, a content creator on the lookout for trends, or an investor monitoring multiple sectors, Gruntly is designed to declutter your informational landscape. Our service is tailored for:

- **Professionals and Entrepreneurs**
- **Content Creators & Researchers**
- **Investors and Analysts**
- **Busy Enthusiasts**
- **Decision Makers**
- **Freelancers and Consultants**

Gruntly essentially serves anyone who values their time and needs a curated flow of information without the burden of sifting through mountains of content.

By paying for Gruntly, you're not just getting a service; you're investing in a more focused, efficient, and less stressful life.

So go ahead, take Gruntly for a spin, and reclaim your time.
