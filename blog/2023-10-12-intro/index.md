Ah, modern life—a beautiful mess of instant messages, buzzing phones, and a never-ending stream of information. If you're like me, you're swimming in a sea of Telegram channels and group chats. We're talking north of a hundred channels here, people! And guess what? My friends are in the same boat, paddling aimlessly through a whirlpool of texts, memes, and updates.

So, there you are, scrolling through messages like a squirrel on caffeine, praying you don't miss something crucial. What if that one buried message is the insider tip that makes you a crypto millionaire? Or the news update that changes your entire business strategy? 

Meet Gruntly — your personalized lifesaver in this choppy information ocean.

Gruntly is a no-nonsense assistant that sifts through your mess—ahem, messages—and sends you a daily digest of what's actually relevant. Think of it as your personal gold panner, sifting through the muddy river of messages to find those precious nuggets of useful information.

Powered by a Telegram bot for starters, Gruntly takes a look at all your channels and, like a loyal dog fetching your slippers, brings you a daily rundown of messages that match your interests. Choose the channels you want monitored, specify your interests, and voilà! You get a neat list that matters to you without the headache of skimming through endless conversations.

You're not just saving time—you're ensuring you don't miss out on something that could be a game-changer for you.

Concerned about the cost? Don't be. There's a free tier where you can monitor one channel for the bargain price of nada, zip, zilch. And if you're an overachiever with a thirst for more, a mere five bucks a month lets you keep tabs on up to 10 channels. Plus, new users get a one-month free trial of the Full plan, because we're nice like that.

Who's Gruntly for? Pretty much everyone who's drowning in too much information. From professionals and entrepreneurs in ever-changing industries to content creators, busy enthusiasts, and decision-makers who need their info fast and relevant.

So, hop in and give Gruntly a spin. Let's turn that overwhelming wave of information into a peaceful stream of knowledge, shall we?

Catch you in the digest!
